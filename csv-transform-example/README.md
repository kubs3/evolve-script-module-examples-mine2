# CSV Transformation Example

## Overview

This is an example of the whole CSV transformation scenario. We will show you how to build a processing pipeline
that can be used to accept CSV data in an API request. The pipeline then transforms the data to JSON using a custom script
and uses a production step to generate a PDF from the data input based on the WFD template.
The PDF is returned as a response.

## Prerequisites
Following tools are needed to be installed in order to be able to build the example modules.
- Git
- NodeJS
- Yarn
- [Bobril build](https://github.com/bobril/bbcore)
- [swarm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quadient/swarm)

## Build the script

First, clone this git repository. Open commandline and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/quadient/evolve-script-module-examples.git
```

Then you need to build the CSV transformation script. In the command line,
switch to the folder `csv-transform-example` and run the
following commands:

```
cd csv-transform-example
swarm login
swarm script upload
```

## Create the Processing Pipeline

The following pictures show the processing pipeline.

**Note**: In the "Print" step, it is necessary to provide a real path to
the `LifeInsuranceQuote_jsonInput.wfd` file in the `ICM Sample Solutions` folder.

The `DataInput` must point to the `request.json` file in the `Working Folder`.

## The request
Here you can see how the request should look.

You must replace:
- `YOUR_API_KEY` with the real API key from the Quadient Cloud and
- `YOUR_PIPELINE` with the created pipeline ID.

```

## The conversion script description
In this section, we will walk you through the source code of the script converting CSV to JSON.

The script is in the [src/index.ts](src/index.ts) file.

The script has two parameters – a resource path of the input and output. We use a resource
connectors concept to abstract away from the details of accessing data.
See the documentation for more details.

Every pipeline script must export two methods:
- getDescription
- execute

### getDescription

The `getDescription` provides general information about the script itself – its name, description,
description of the parameters. It is quiet obvious, so see details. Worth to mention could be
the two input parameters – `source` and `target`. Please note, that the `source` type is defined as
`InputResource` – so its value will be defined by editor of the pipeline and it will point to the
source of the CSV data. In our scenario described above, it will point to the request data, so the actual
value will be `request://`.

The parameter `target` is of the `OutputResource` type, and in our scenario, it will point to a file in a
working folder, where it can be used by the `Print` step as a DataInput file.

But the script is written in a generic way and it doesn't care where will be the actual location of the output.
That is how the concept of resource connectors works.

### execute

The `execute` method contains the main body of the script. First, it takes parameter `source`. Because it is the
`InputResource` type, it means that the actual value is a string containing kind of URI of the input data that can be read.
So the value is accessed with `context.parameters.source as string` piece of code. The URI can be opened
for reading as a *readable* stream with the `context.openReadText` method, resulting in:
```typescript
const input = await context.openReadText(context.parameters.source as string);
```

We work with the output data URI in the similar way and open a *writable* stream with it, so we can write data to it:
```typescript
const output = await context.openWriteText(context.parameters.target as string);
```

Note that we are using `openReadText` instead of just `openRead`. The `openReadText` method
opens stream for reading the input data decoded as a text in UTF-8, not binary.

We use the [stream API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API),
which is a part of Evolve scripting engine. In this example specifically, we
use [TransformStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream).

There are readily available `StringToCsvTransformStream` and `JsonToStringTransformStream`
classes in the [evolve-data-transformations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quadient/evolve-data-transformations) library.
They help to transform the string input into the stream of CSV events. Our custom transformer (highlighted in yellow in the picture below)
translates the CSV events into the JSON events and then we use the already available class to transform
the JSON events to string (deserialization).

![Streams](doc/stream-flow.drawio.png)

```typescript
await input
    .pipeThrough(new StringToCsvTransformStream())
    .pipeThrough(new CsvCustomTransformStream())
    .pipeThrough(new JsonToStringTransformStream())
    .pipeTo(output);
```

Now we can look at the `CsvCustomTransformStream` more deeply. It extends `TransformStream`, and in constructor, it
provides an object with the following three methods:

- **`start`** – method called at the beginning of the stream transformation. In our case, it produces the beginning of the JSON (in the form of `JsonEvent` objects)

- **`transform`** – method called for every chunk of data. Because of the previous transformers in the chain,
  it receives `CSVEvent` objects and produces `JsonEvent` objects as a result.
  The received object is the first parameter of the method. The second parameter is a controller – an object
  which can be used to produce the output data.
  We are making use of a special type of JSON event – `JsonEventType.ANY_VALUE` – this type
  of a `JsonEvent` can be used to output the whole
  JavaScript object, so we don't need to produce low-level JSON events for all individual
  objects, all their properties, arrays, etc. We just construct a javascript object and put it to the
  output, wrapped with JsonEvent of type `ANY_VALUE`. It means object like this:
  ```typescript
  let myObject = { /** my object properties */ }
  let event = {type: JsonEventType.ANY_VALUE, data: myObject};
  ```
  The event is then sent to output of the transform stream via the `controller` object. This leads to:
  ```typescript
  controller.enqueue({type: JsonEventType.ANY_VALUE, data: obj});
  ```

- **`flush`** – Is called when the transformed stream is fully read, wrapping the end of the JSON output.

The rest of the code is there just to take care of the output file in case there is some of the same name already,
covering error states, etc.

So the whole source code of the main transformation part is:
```typescript
class CsvCustomTransformStream extends TransformStream<CsvEvent, JsonEvent> {
  constructor() {
    super({
      start: async(controller) => {
        // Begin the JSON with '{ "Clients": [' sequence.
        controller.enqueue(E_START_OBJECT);
        controller.enqueue({type: JsonEventType.PROPERTY_NAME, data: "Clients"});
        controller.enqueue(E_START_ARRAY);
      },

      transform: async (event, controller) => {
        switch (event.type) {
          case "values":
            const d = event.data;
            // construct js object from the CSV values array
            const obj = {
              "CustID": d[0],
              "CustName": d[1],
              "CustMid": d[2],
              // etc... - see source code
              "Dec": d[46],
            }
            // output the JSON event with the constructed object 
            controller.enqueue({type: JsonEventType.ANY_VALUE, data: obj});
        }
      },

      flush: async(controller) => {
        // End the JSON with ']}' sequence.
        controller.enqueue(E_END_ARRAY);
        controller.enqueue(E_END_OBJECT);
      }
    });
  }
}

```
